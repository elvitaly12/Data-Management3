* fix table.on
* when clicking on an entry-> show designed card

* design html page using css (at last)
* very very optional: filter markers when filtering table

done:

* implement basic html page with upload button
* parse the csv file using papa parse
* implement table logic-> we want the table to be interactive (filter,sorting,pagination)
* create user for mapbox to get a token
* check why buttons "download" and "clear" dont appear after first clear and another input file
* check  why download file doesnt work
* check if user clicked submit before enter a file
* implement leaflet logic -> given a coordinate we want it zoom in the in the map
* add markers for every place
* extract coordinates from selected entry and send them to zoomTo (and remain only one marker.)
